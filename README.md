Web-Scrapting-and-Automation Project
This script uses Python and Selenium to scrape startup data from the Y Combinator companies directory. It collects the company name, batch, and description from each listing. Then it visits each company's page to extract founder names and their LinkedIn profiles. The output is saved in a CSV file.

Challenges included handling dynamically loaded content and ensuring each link was valid before visiting.
